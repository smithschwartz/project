  <h2 class="m-subhead">In 2014, I began a position at Say Media, as a UX Engineer in San Francisco.</h2>
  <p class="m-body">During my time at Say, I’ve served at the project lead on numerous successful projects which have had a big impact on the Tempest product. These projects include:</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">2 Column Article Layout:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Created a dynamic design for Tempest detail pages with an added spots for a 3x6 ads on every article and recipe page while balancing a clean, engaging design across sites.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Premium Reader Experience:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Designed and built a completely ad-free version of Tempest, to provide a subscription-based revenue model to publishers.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">New Headers:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Built out numerous configuration options for site headers, as a way to put brands at the front and center, each site can have their own, distinct look and feel.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Revenue Reporting Prototype:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Built a rapid prototype of the numerous interactions of revenue reporting, which can greatly reduce engineering time by working out design implementations before working in the browser.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Self instigated projects:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">During my time at Say, I’ve been the lead and contributed to numerous projects. I’ve also been proactive in seeing a need and creating and executing many other projects.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Unification of Hub Components:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Previously, we had separate markup and CSS for each content type that rendered as a card, (article, person, rich term, etc.) even though the design for each card was the same. I created a new ‘list style’ for each card type with unified markup and a new, shared CSS file so that we could easily display cards from any content type. This helped us scale quickly and gained consistency of design and code.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Detail Page Generalization:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Even though each detail page has various types of content, the bulk of that content is repeatable throughout Tempest. I unified the class name structure across content types so that we have a more unified CSS structure. This not only brought consistency in design, it makes it much easier to make changes like supporting various media embeds, adding or removing ad support (premium experience) and producing new designs and layouts.
</p>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">High Standards of Execution:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">In the past, we had numerous visual bugs and layout issues that required daily fixes. I brought a level of execution and visual testing that previously did not exist. Now, our number of visual or CSS related bug reports is drastically lower, even though we have scaled immensely and added many new features.</p>
</section>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Color System Cleanup:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">The release of Canvas brought us more customizability, but also lots of technical and design debt. We had a new color palette that had been added to our configuration system, but the old color palette was still in use and being utilized by many sites. This meant that our system supported as many as 43 unique color definitions per site. This was not only a complex technical issue that needed addressing it was a broken design system as well. Now, sites can define only 7 unique colors per site that are repeated throughout their design. This project required changes in Phoenix, Tempest and Schema, and also a keen design eye to check each site as I made these changes.

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Subnav Component:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">My main goal in every project I work on is to make each feature as reusable and flexible as possible. When setting out to build the subscriptions revenue project, we needed to add a dropdown menu to phoenix. Instead of making this a unique snowflake, I built this as a reusable component. This component will become a subnav. This means that in the future, sites like climbing.com  can have a more complex navigation structure by adding the navigation component into a full-width subnav component.</p>

<section class="l-panel">
  <h2 class="m-subhead">Professional Development Circle:</h2>
  <p class="m-body">Here, I led initiatives like instituting Random 1:1’s, library signup trip (free safari online classes), brought in an outside speaker for team building, all while brainstorming various ways to help grow our group as individual contributors as well as a team.</p>
